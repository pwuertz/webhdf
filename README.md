WebHDF
======

Webhdf is a web browser based viewer for HDF5 files. It is driven by a Python
WSGI application that is either deployed on a webserver or started locally.

For displaying the content, the browser frontend uses recent HTML+JS features
that are found in Firefox (v19.0), Chrome (v25.0), Opera (v12.1) and Internet
Exlorer (v10.0). The backend requires a Python interpreter including the h5py
and webob modules.
